            Here is some places I traveled to.
        </p>

        <p> 
            In 2018, I went to Moutain Huang with my friend,
            carrying a heavy tent and slept one night there to watch the sun falling and raising.
            And, unfortunately, the camera in my smartphone was very poor and 
            I cannot capture the stars in the night sky.
        </p>

        <p> 
            After Moutain Huang, I went to Moutain Changbai.
            It's much different and I make some new friends during this travel.
        </p>

        <p>
            And sometimes I went out for marathon contest, but usually I won't take
            pictures for this, because I'm too tired.. 
        </p>

        <p>
            Going to another city for a marathon contest feels just like travel for me. 
            It let me forget all the things in real life and just run.
        </p>
